# Quick-Learn
A collection of short projects used to learn python while working at JHUAPL

6/8/22 -> Worked on a simple blackjack program, this was my first time writing python in several years, so learning the syntax for loops, classes, and objects was my main focus. This project in total took ~2 hours.
