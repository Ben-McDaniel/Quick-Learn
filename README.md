# Quick-Learn
A collection of short projects used to learn python while working at JHUAPL

6/8/22 -> Worked on a simple blackjack program, this was my first time writing python in several years, so learning the syntax for loops, classes, and objects was my main focus. This project took a couple of hours over the course of 2 days.
